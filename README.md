 # What is Phishing?
 Phishing is a social engineering attack where cybercriminals trick individuals into revealing sensitive 
 information, such as passwords, financial details, or personal data. These attacks often come in the form of:
 * Email Phishing – Fraudulent emails pretending to be from trusted sources.
 * Spear Phishing – Targeted attacks on specific individuals or organizations.
 * Whaling – Phishing aimed at high-profile executives.
 * Vishing & Smishing – Voice and SMS-based phishing scams.

 # How to Spot Phishing Attempts
 * Check for spelling errors and suspicious sender addresses.
 * Be cautious of urgent requests demanding immediate action.
 * Hover over links to verify their destination before clicking.
 * Never share personal information unless absolutely necessary.
 * Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.

 # Preventative Measures
 * Enable MFA on all accounts.
 * Regularly update passwords and use a password manager.
 * Educate others about phishing risks.
 * Avoid clicking on unknown links or downloading suspicious attachments
